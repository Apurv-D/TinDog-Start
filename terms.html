            <p>
                Last revised on November 19, 2021
                <br>
                Key change in this version: We’ve clarified that MTCH Technology Services Limited, which operates our European Headquarters, is responsible for our service in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
                <br><br>
                For a summary of our Terms of Use, go to <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/summary-of-terms/intl/en">Summary of Terms.</a> 
                <br><br>
                Welcome to Tinder. If you live in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, these Terms of Use are between you and:
                <br><br>
                MTCH Technology Services Limited ("MTCH Technology") WeWork Charlemont Exchange 42 Charlemont Street Dublin 2, D02 R593 Ireland
                <br><br>
                If you live in Japan, these Terms of Use apply between you and:

            <h4>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</h4>
            <p>
                By creating a Tinder account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), Safety Tips, and Community Guidelines, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on gotinder.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes to your rights or obligations, we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Eligibility.</h4>
            <p>
                You are not authorized to create an account or access or use the Service or systems it resides on unless all of the following are true: <br><br>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>you are at least 18 years of age.</li>
                    <li> you can form a binding contract with Tinder,</li>
                    <li>you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction (for example, you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition),</li>
                    <li>you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, and</li>
                    <li>you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>3. Your Account.</h4>
            <p>
                In order to use Tinder, you may sign in using a number of ways, including by Facebook login. If you choose to use your Facebook login, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for Tinder, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact us.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</h4>
            <p>
                Tindog is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in "Settings" in the Service. However, if you use a third party payment account such as Apple’s App Store or iTunes Store, as applicable (“App Store”) or the Google Play Store, you will need to manage in app purchases through such an account to avoid additional billing. Tinder may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.
            </p>
            <p>
                For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where we reasonably consider that (i) giving notice is legally prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or (ii) any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, Tinder, and/or our affiliates (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Service), we will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.
            </p>

            <p>
                After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Tinder: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.
            </p>
